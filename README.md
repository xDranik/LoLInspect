LoL_app
=======
Web Application using the League of Legends API, built with AngularJS.<br/>
This App allows users to search for summoners and compare their stats with specific champions (or overall).

You'll need to set up a few things to get this to work:
* Include a global var in js/controllers.js named `apikey` and set that equal to your API key. Or load it from js/ihazkey.js in your html like I did (haha)
* Have the  code running on a webserver so the AJAX requests to Riot's API can be made
